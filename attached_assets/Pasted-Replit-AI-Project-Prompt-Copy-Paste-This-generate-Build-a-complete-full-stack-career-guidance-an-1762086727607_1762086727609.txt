Replit AI Project Prompt (Copy-Paste This)

/generate
Build a complete full-stack career guidance and mentorship web application using Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS + Prisma + PostgreSQL + NextAuth.js + Stripe Checkout, optimized to run efficiently on Replit’s free tier with minimal compute usage. The goal is to create a professional yet resource-light platform where a client can sell career guidance or mentorship courses (both recorded and live), users can browse and buy courses securely, and students can track lesson progress.

🧩 Structure the project as follows:

/app — main Next.js App Router with routes for /, /courses, /courses/[slug], /dashboard, /admin, and /api.

/components — reusable React components (Navbar, Footer, CourseCard, DashboardLayout, ProgressBar, TestimonialCard, etc.).

/lib — helper functions for Stripe, Auth, and future AI integrations.

/prisma — Prisma schema and seed data.

/styles — global Tailwind and layout styles.

⚙️ Setup details:

Initialize a Next.js + TypeScript app.

Add Tailwind CSS with a clean “modern-classic” theme (Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body).

Configure Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (connect to a free Neon.tech or Supabase DB).

Set up NextAuth.js for authentication (email/password + Google).

Add Stripe Checkout for course purchases (store webhooks and enrollment updates in DB).

Store videos as external links (Cloudflare Stream, Vimeo, or YouTube unlisted) to save Replit bandwidth.

🧠 Core Features:

Public Pages:

Home (/) with hero banner, featured courses, testimonials, and mentor bios.

Courses page (/courses) with filtering and search.

Course detail page (/courses/[slug]) showing syllabus, pricing, instructor info, and a “Buy Now” button.

Auth & Enrollment:

Users can sign up/login and enroll in courses via Stripe Checkout.

Stripe webhook endpoint (/api/webhook) validates payment and creates an enrollment record.

Student Dashboard (/dashboard):

Lists purchased courses and tracks lesson completion.

Displays a progress bar and “Mark as Complete” buttons per lesson.

Admin Panel (/admin):

Allows admin to create/edit courses and upload lesson video URLs.

Displays total enrollments and sales summary.

💾 Database Models (Prisma):

User → id, name, email, password, role (student/admin)

Course → id, title, slug, description, price, category, instructorId, published

Lesson → id, courseId, title, videoUrl, orderIndex, duration

Enrollment → id, userId, courseId, purchasedAt

Progress → id, userId, lessonId, completed

🎨 UI Design:

Use a clean, timeless design — white background, elegant typography, and soft color palette.

Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Add trust-building elements: mentor credentials, secure payment badges, student testimonials, and a contact form.

🚀 Performance & Scalability:

Enable SSR for SEO and faster load times.

Cache course lists in memory.

Lazy-load videos and images.

Keep functions modular for future scaling (e.g., separate Stripe and Auth logic in /lib).

🧠 AI Integration (prepare but don’t implement yet):

Create placeholders for an “AI Career Coach” chat feature (/api/ai/coach) using OpenAI or Gemini API.

Comment clearly where AI integrations would go later.

🧰 Developer Setup:

Add ESLint + Prettier for formatting.

Include .env.local.example for environment variables (DATABASE_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, etc.).

Add npm run dev, npm run build, and npm run deploy scripts.

Seed the DB with sample data (one instructor, two demo courses, a few lessons).

🌐 Deployment:

Make it runnable directly on Replit using npm run dev.

Include a README with setup + deploy steps (to Vercel or Supabase).

Use free services only — no paid APIs or heavy compute.

🧩 Future Features (comment placeholders):

Mentorship booking system with Google Calendar.

Discussion forums.

AI-based skill assessments and personalized recommendations.

Certificates of completion.

✅ Final Deliverable:

A single Replit project folder containing a ready-to-run Next.js full-stack web app.

Clean, modular, well-commented code.

Fully functional auth, course purchase, and progress tracking.

Works on Replit free tier and deployable to Vercel instantly.
